test GitHub queries for specific results we know were reported on various
weekly Developer In Residence Reports
15 Nov - 21 Nov 2021: https://lukasz.langa.pl/4f7c2091-2a74-48ab-99d7-8521c4fa8363/
30 Aug - 5 Sept 2021:  https://lukasz.langa.pl/94b5086c-81df-498a-9f8b-f9e06f5d9538/

Tests can take some time since PyGitHub does not enable limit all queries by date and
cpython/cpython is a large repo (e.g. query for PR pulls from entire repo unlike
Issues API, where you can spec a "since" date).  Ideally we'd only like PRs modified
between date ranges to pull less, but that is client-side responsibility
